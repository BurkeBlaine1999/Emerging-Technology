    "My code works by using a for loop with a while loop inside. \n",
    "The for loop will run 101 times due to the decimal point counting as a character.\n",

    "We start by setting the maxConstraint equal to 9 as the values can only be elements of natural numbers from values of 0 to 9.\n",
    "The while loop calculates the nearest possible number to the value of c.\n",
    "For example at the beginning C is equal to 2. \n",
    "The algorithm \"maxConstraint * (20*root + maxConstraint) > c\"  runs , taking -1 off maxConstraint everytime until it is equal to 1 in this case.\n",
    "This is because \" 1((20)(0) + 1) > c\" is true and is the closest possible number to c.\n",
    "This then adds the max constraint to the digits list.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then set y equal to \"maxConstraint * (20*root + maxConstraint)\" as it returns the largest number that can be created that is less than c. We will later use y to calculate the remainder.\n",
    "\n",
    "On line 24 , root is set to the value of \"(10*root) + maxConstraint\". Here we are ensuring that the number we are dealing with is always an integer, such to avoid python's float precision limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then set c equal to \"100*(c-y)\" as it gives us back the new remainder which will be fed back through the while loop.\n",
    "Due to the square root of 2 being irrational there will be infinite remainders.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code will continue this cycle until the for loop breaks at 100 decimal places.\n",
