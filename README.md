# Emerging Technology Tasks
A variety of [tasks](https://github.com/BurkeBlaine1999/Emerging-Technology/blob/main/Emerging%20Technology%20-%20Tasks.ipynb) provided to me by my lecturer [Ian McLoughlin](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin).

## Task 1 -- Square Root of 2

In this task we were told to get the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places without importing anything to aid us. 
After researching I found and used the [Digit-by-digit calculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Digit-by-digit_calculation) in order to help calculate the square root of 2 accuratly to 100 decimal places. 


## Task 2 -- Chi² testing

Chi² testing is a statistical hypothesis test simlar to a t-test. It's used to check if two different categories are independent/dependent of eachother
In this task we were given a table from wikipedia which had a Chi-squared value of approximately 24.6. We had to use [scipy.stats](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html) to verify that was indeed the correct value.

I succesfully determined that 24.6 was correct and also learned that that A & B are not independent of each other ,similarly for C & D. Meaning that A & B and  C & D are from the same sample populations.

## Task 3 -- Standard Deviation

For this task we were required to find the sample standard deviation and popluation standard deviation of a number and determine what was more accurate.
Ultimatly the sample standard deviation is more accurate as with the popluation standard deviation , its very difficult to collect a sample from a large population.

## Task 4 -- Fisher’s Iris data set

For the final task we were asked to use [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to apply k-means clustering to [Fisher’s famous Iris data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).

I used machine learning to estimate which flower was which in the graph by using the sepal length and width of the flowers.
