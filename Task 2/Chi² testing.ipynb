    "### Initial Test\n",
    "In the initial test we see that the p-value is 0.0004. From this we can reject the null hypothesis and accept that at least one of our samples is not independent due to the p-value being less than 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A & B\n",
    "When having just A & B together we receieve a p-value of 0.002. This means that the null hypothesis is  rejected and A & B are not independent of eachother.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A & C and B & C\n",
    "When having just A & C together we receieve a p-value of 0.307. This means that the null hypothesis is not  rejected and A & B are independent of eachother.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the same when using B & C. The p-value is 0.0792 meaning the null hypothesis is not  rejected and B & C are independent of eachother.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C & D\n",
    "When having just C & D together we receieve a p-value of 0.0164. This means that the null hypothesis is  rejected and C & D are not independent of eachother.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (A+B) & (C+D)\n",
    "For my final test I added A + B and C + D. My p-value was 0.118  meaning the null hypothesis is not rejected and that A & B are not independent of each other ,similarly for C & D.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new sample of (A+B) is independent of our other new sample (C+D) which confirmed the hypothesis above that A and B are of the same population but different to C and D. And vice versa\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conculsion\n",
    "From the above we can reasonably conclude that A & B are sampled from the same population, similarly for C & D.\n"
